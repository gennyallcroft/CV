## Genny Allcroft

I understand complex tax technical issues and provide large multi-national clients with clear and practical advice. Having gained a First Class Masters degree in Chemistry from the University of Oxford, I started working at Deloitte five years ago and am an Associate Director (and a Chartered Tax Advisor) in the indirect tax team. I recognise the importance of technology to automate and simplify complex tax issues for clients and am excited to improve my software development skills so I can lead indirect tax technology projects for clients.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

- My role at Deloitte for the past five years has involved digesting large complex business problems and providing clients with clear and easy-to-understand tax advice. 
- I was promoted to Associate Director after just four years at Deloitte - this involved achieving "double promotions" in two consecutive years. This was a first for my department at Deloitte and is a reflection of my high performance and value I add to the business.
- In April 2019 I joined Deloitte's Digital Tax Solutions team to support the development team with our VAT return filer tool to handle the digital submission requirements introduced by Making Tax Digital in the UK. With no background in software development, I quickly grasped how to use Microsoft Visual Studio to code in C#, angularJS, HTML and CSS to add functionality and make improvements to the user interface of the tool which is currently being used and paid for by hundreds of clients.
- A large global financial data and media business valued me as an advisor so much that they requested that I joined their business on secondment for six months in 2016 where I led the indirect tax work associated with an acquisition and advised on global indirect tax issues.
- I passed the exams necessary to become a Chartered Tax Advisor (the gold standard of tax professional qualifications). My exam paper was published as a model answer for the Cross Border Indirect Tax advisory paper.

#### Project Management

- I have managed a large number of multi-national tax projects, involving coordination with Deloitte firms all over the world. I managed a Â£1m global indirect tax review for a giant media client, which covered advising on the indirect tax opportunities and risks in 28 jurisdictions in a very short timeframe. 
- I partnered with a technology giant looking to revolutionise indirect tax compliance for the sellers on its online platform. This involved managing input from subject matter experts from across the firm and in 7 jurisdictions in the EU. I was the key point of contact for the client and the SMEs and was responsible for ensuring the client got what they wanted and it was delivered in time.

#### Relationship Building

- In addition to my strong analytical and project management skills, I am also an exceptional "people person". I have a high emotional intelligence and naturally build strong relationships with people I meet. 
- The people I work with like me - a recent anonymous survey taken by the people reporting to me awarded me more than 4.5/5 in all six areas called out for people leadership. I was awarded with 5/5 for being a good role model and the feedback I've received from the people I work with is that I'm good fun, enthusiastic and have good energy.

## Hobbies

I love sports and being outside - I play netball and enjoy unusual gym classes. I have a passion for hiking and have walked all the way across Corsica from North to South. I also really love to travel and explore - there's nothing better than getting the rucksack on and exploring a new country.
